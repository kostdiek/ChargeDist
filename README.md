# ChargeDist
Charge State Distribution Program for Single and Double Carbon Stripper Foils 

May need to rebuild for this program to work on a few machine. 
The command ./ChargeDist will run the program. It will walk you through the process for both single and double carbon stripper foils for the FN tandem accelerator at the University of Notre Dame. One can pick specific charge states or output to a csv file all possible combinations. The output file is array.txt. It will overwrite any previous data in that file.
